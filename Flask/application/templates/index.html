      <h2>Audio Analysis of EDM and Lofi Music</h2>
      Used Spotify's API to retrieve the audio features of Lofi and EDM tracks on Spotify for a
          in-depth analysis of attributes which makes them different from one another.
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Inspiration behind the analysis:</h4>
        <p>
          - <u>Lofi</u> : Typically seen to be used to de-stress at the end of the day or studying needs
          <br>
          - <u>EDM</u> : Uplifting one's mood, rave festivals/concerts, jamming out
          <br>
          - <u>Curiosity</u> : What attributes best fits each music type and how does it link to the activities others use them for in their daily lives</p>

      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Tools Used:</h4>
      <p><u>Back-end:</u>
        <br>
        - Pycharm
        <br>
        - Python
        <br>
        - Jupyter Notebook
        <br>
        - Pandas
        <br>
        - NumPy
        <br>
        - Matplotlib
        <br>
        - SQLite Database</p>
        <p><u>Front-end:</u>
        <br>
        - Flask
        <br>
        - HTML/CSS
          <br></p>

      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Method</h4>
      <p>1. Developed a pipeline to retrieve metadata from API:
        <br>
        - Track title
        <br>
        - Release title
        <br>
        - Artist name
        <br>
        - Artist genre
        <br>
        - Release Date
        <br>
        - Audio features:
        <br>
        - Danceability
        <br>
        - Energy
        <br>
        - Key
        <br>
        - Loudness
        <br>
        - Mode
        <br>
        - Speechiness
        <br>
        - Acousticness
        <br>
        - Instrumentalness
        <br>
        - Liveness
        <br>
        - Valence
        <br>
        - Tempo
        <br>
        - Duration(ms)
        <br>
        - For a more in-depth description of the audio features, refer back to this [link](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features)
        <br>
        2. Uploaded the data into a SQLite database
        <br>
	    - The tracks obtained and loaded into the database were from Spotify featured playlists and split into 2 different tables based on their genre for analysis
        <br>
        3. Uploaded SQLite database into Jupyter Notebook for analysis:
	    <br>
        - Correlations
	    <br>
        - Audio features vs frequency
		<br>
        - Used to determine which audio features are prominant in each genre
        <br>
        4. Created front-end on Flask using Python and bootstrap for presentation
        <br>
        5. Wrote up conclusions based off of findings from analysis
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Discussion</h4>
      <p>
        - Spotify tracks do not include track genre:
        <br>
	    - However, there are artist genres which may not be accurate to the track itself as artists likes to try new techniques and skills which could place their song in a genre different than their own.
		<br>
        - Could be an idea to add genre to assist with their ML/recommendations, if not already used for recomending music</p>
        <br>
      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        TBD
      </p>
