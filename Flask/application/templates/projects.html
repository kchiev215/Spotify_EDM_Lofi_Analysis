            Rockamendation is a website app that helps the user find outdoor boulder routes based on location and difficulty level of the climb.
            The creation of this website app started with the eagerness to climb outdoors for the first time as I am an avid indoor rock climber
            and the locations are limited to the local tri-state area (PA, NJ, DE). Along with the location and the difficulty of the route,
            the website will include a short description of the route such as how to start the route and a link for additional information from
            an outside resource.

            For this project, I worked with a cohort member of the Java track, Fitru Fitru. I was personally in charge of the ETL process, which
            included creating a webscraping tool to extract information from the website, mountainproject.com, transforming the data
            for usability, and loading it onto a SQL database. Tools used includes Jupyter Notebook, Python, and SQL database.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fitru Fitru was in charge of the front-end aspect of the website where he used Spring, Java, and SQL database along with React.
